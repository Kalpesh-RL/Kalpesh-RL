- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kalpesh-RL
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in practical implementation of Reinforcement learning for Chemical Process Control and Optimization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing a methodology for RL implementation that incorporates process domain knowledge into RL problem formulation to make the implementation safe, fast and explainable.
- ðŸ“« I can be reached by email at kalpesh_priti@yahoo.com
